	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Derek earned his combined Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity from the University of Maryland. His main interests are deep learning and cybersecurity.</p>
	<p>Self-taught, he started programming Minecraft mods at the age of 14. Upon entering Maryland for his undergrad, he made sure to take advantage of its numerous opportunities such as the FIRE program. After completing this three semester long program, he returned as a peer mentor to aid the research educator, Dr. Raymond Tu, keep their curriculum relevant with state of the art models such as DETR. Much of what he knows about deep learning in practice came from his time with FIRE.
	Additionally, Derek was awarded the Scholarship for Service to help fund his undergraduate education. Derek mentored FIRE students for as long as he could but alas he only had a finite number of semesters. In 2021, he received his dual Bachelor's degree in computer science and applied math with the distinction of <i>magna cum laude</i>.</p>
	<p>Derek is most proud of the classroom aid app, InstructAR, that was developed during his graduate studies. This augmented reality app allows teachers to gain insight into the classroom sentiment in near real time by leveraging deep learning on mobile devices.</p>
	<p>In his free time, Derek loves to play an egregious amount of Minecraft, Subnautica, Civilization II and XCOM.</p>

	<h3>FIRE</h3>
	<p>This is a demo of object detection with DETR (Detection Transformer). I worked on this with two other wonderful peer mentors.<br><br>

	</p>
	<p>This was one of the tutorials I made for the students. Keep in mind that this is tailored to freshmen students.<br><br>

	<div id="ACES" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>ACES</h3>
	<p>This repo was used for a honeypot project in HACS202. I extended the functionality of the MITM to scramble (interactive) SSH keystroke inputs. <small>(We wanted to troll the heckers.)</small><br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/chromestone/MITM">https://github.com/chromestone/MITM</a>
	</p> 
	<p>In HACS498, we worked with professionals from AWS to prototype a device tracker using only WIFI signals. We used 3 Raspberry PIs to pick up device signals and triangulated the location of the device with mixed results. I'm unsure whether if I can share the code publicly.</p>

	<div id="MISC" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
	<p>This is my first computer vision project dating all the way back to 2015, the good old HS days. The orientation of the triangle is determined from the webcam images and mapped to robot motor inputs.</p>
