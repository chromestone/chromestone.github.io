	<h1>Derek Zhang</h1><br>
	<h2>Bio</h2><br>
	<p>Derek is a computer science MS student at the University of Maryland. His main interests are deep learning and cybersecurity. Self-taught, he started programming Minecraft mods at the age of 14. Upon entering Maryland for his undergrad, he made sure to take advantage of its numerous opportunities. For instance, after the completion of the three semester long FIRE program, he returned as a peer mentor. There he helped the research educator, Dr. Raymond Tu, keep their cirriculum relevant with state of the art models such as DETR. Much of what he knows about deep learning in practice came from his time with FIRE. Derek stayed with the FIRE program as long as he could but alas he only had a finite number of semesters. He graduated with the honor of <i>magna cum laude</i> in 2021 and now holds a BS degree in computer science and applied math. At the same time, Derek also earned a minor in cybersecurity (ACES) and is also a Scholarship for Service recipient. Lastly, in his free time, he loves to play an egregious amount of Minecraft, Civilization II and XCOM.</p>
