	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Derek is a computer science MS graduate from the University of Maryland. His main interests are deep learning and cybersecurity. Self-taught, he started programming Minecraft mods at the age of 14. Upon entering Maryland for his undergrad, he made sure to take advantage of its numerous opportunities. For instance, after the completion of the three semester long FIRE program, he returned as a peer mentor. There he helped the research educator, Dr. Raymond Tu, keep their cirriculum relevant with state of the art models such as DETR. Much of what he knows about deep learning in practice came from his time with FIRE. Derek stayed with the FIRE program as long as he could but alas he only had a finite number of semesters. He graduated with the honor of <i>magna cum laude</i> in 2021 and now holds a BS degree in computer science and applied math. At the same time, Derek also earned a minor in cybersecurity (ACES) and is a Scholarship for Service recipient. Lastly, in his free time, he loves to play an egregious amount of Minecraft, Civilization II and XCOM.</p>

	<h3>FIRE</h3>
	<p>This is a demo of object detection with DETR (Detection Transformer). I worked on this with two other wonderful peer mentors.</p>

	<p>This was one of the tutorials I made for the students. Keep in mind that this is tailored to freshmen students.</p>

	<div id="ACES" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>ACES</h3>
	<p>This repo was used for a honeypot project in HACS202. I extended the functionality of the MITM to scramble (interactive) SSH keystroke inputs. <small>(We wanted to troll the heckers.)</small></p> 
	<a href="https://github.com/chromestone/MITM">https://github.com/chromestone/MITM</a>
	<p>In HACS498, we worked with professionals from AWS to prototype a device tracker using only WIFI signals. We used 3 Raspberry PIs to pick up device signals and triangulated the location of the device with mixed results. I'm unsure whether if I can share the code publicly.</p>

	<div id="MISC" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
	<p>This is my first computer vision project dating all the way back to 2015, the good old HS days. The orientation of the triangle is determined from the webcam images and mapped to robot motor inputs.</p>
